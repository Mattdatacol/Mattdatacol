# Welcome to my world of data analytics 😎 📊

## 1. Who am I?
My username contains a subtle pun: **Matthieu** (spelled in French, s'il-vous-plaît 🥖), combined with **Da Col** (in Italian this time 🍝), joined by **data** (in SQL, PYTHON, EXCEL, Tableau... 💻). 

I previously served as an officer in the French army, specializing in finance, budgeting, and wages. I had to extract data in a no-code Business Object environment and make sense of it using Excel to aid decision-making for cost-effectiveness and political strategies. I was then introduced to Excel Power Pivot models, Power BI, and Qlik Sense, which sparked my curiosity for more advanced data analytics and visualization technologies. This led me on a great data journey of self-improvement and a very helpful tuition with CareerFoundry.

## 2. What am I currently learning?
I'm delving deeper into machine learning to explore its vast potential. Currently, I'm focusing on statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries for linear regressions, clustering, forecasting, time-series ARIMAs, and classification models like KNN, ANN, and decision trees. 

I'm also learning about Python apps (Streamlit and Taipy) to help share some storytelling about my latest projects.

## 3. What am I looking to collaborate on?
I'm interested in collaborating on data projects that require insightful analysis. 
I'm mostly drawn to the fields of healthcare, business optimization, defense, and analytical accountability.
I am particularly enthusiastic about projects involving machine learning, as they offer valuable opportunities for growth.
