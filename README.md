# Welcome to my world of data analytics :sunglasses: :chart:
## 1. Who am I ?

You'll get from my username that there is an almost hidden pun intended: **Matthieu** (spelled in French, s'il-vous-pla√Æt :baguette_bread:), combined to **Da Col** (in Italian this time :spaghetti:), joined by **data** (in SQL, PYTHON, EXCEL, Tableau... :desktop_computer:).

Previously working in the French army as an officer, specialized in finance, budgeting and wages, I had to extract data on a no-code Business Object environment and make sens out of it using Excel in order to help my hierarchy's decision making, both for costs effectives and political strategies. I was then introduced to Excel Power Pivots models, Power BI and Clik Sense, opening wide my curiosity to more advanced technologies meant for data analytics and vizualisations : It brought me to a great data journey of self improvement and a very helpfull tuition with CareerFoundry.

## 2. What am I currently learning

I'm starting to dig deeper into machine learning since I know its great potential. Where I'm standing now is mostly about linear regression, forecasting, ARIMAS and Prophet.
I also start to learn about python apps (Streamlit and Taipy) that will help share some storytelling about my latest projects.

## 3. What am I looking to collaborate on ?

Any data project in need of some insight uncovering ! I am mostly interested in the fields of healthcare, business optimizaton, defense and analytical accountability. If there is some machine learning involed in the project, the better: any opportunity to grow is very valuable to me !
